# Hello, I'm Yeray

I'm a full stack software engineer based in London, UK. I work as a freelancer helping companies develop maintainable and scalable projects.

I code primarily in Python and Javascript and have experience in Ruby, Objective-C, or C#, but most of all I love clean code.

I also like to write about code, usually articles that help people get started on certain technologies or practices that I've struggled with or am passionate about. Have look at the [blog](/) or [my Medium page](https://medium.com/@yeraydiazdiaz/) if you're interested.

## Projects

Here's a quick summary of my personal projects, you can find more on my [Github profile][github]:

- [Lunr.py](https://readthedocs.org/projects/lunr/),  A Python implementation of [Lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/), aiming to bring the simple and powerful full text search capabilities of Lunr.js into Python guaranteeing results as close as the original implementation as possible.
- [Tailsocket](https://github.com/yeraydiazdiaz/tailsocket), a WebSocket application to tail files to the browser. Using [Tornado](http://tornadoweb.org/), [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for the frontend.
- [Tornado H2](https://github.com/yeraydiazdiaz/tornado_h2), an HTTP/2 server integrating [hyper-h2](https://python-hyper.org/h2/en/stable/) with [Tornado](http://tornadoweb.org/).
- [A collection of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/yeraydiazdiaz/notebooks) with Python examples and insights I've found interesting.
- Code samples from [*Asyncio for the Working Python Developer*](https://github.com/yeraydiazdiaz/asyncio-ftwpd) and [*Asyncio Coroutine Patterns: Beyond await*](https://github.com/yeraydiazdiaz/asyncio-coroutine-patterns)
