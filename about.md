# Hello, I'm Yeray (pronounced Yer-i-ee)

I'm a software engineer living and working in London. I do consultancy helping companies on their web projects where I'm comfortable at in backend and frontend.

I work primarily in Python and Javascript and have experience with Ruby, Objective-C and C#, but mostly I love clean, maintanable code.

I also write about code, usually articles that help people get started on certain technologies or practices that I've struggled or am passionate about. Have look at the [blog](/) or [my Medium page](https://medium.com/@yeraydiazdiaz/) if you're interested.

## Projects
