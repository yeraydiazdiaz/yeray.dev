# Hello, I'm Yeray

I'm a software engineer based in London, UK. I work as a freelancer helping companies develop maintainable and scalable projects.

I code primarily in Python and JavaScript and have experience in Elixir, Ruby, Objective-C, and C#, but most of all I love clean code.

I'm a moderator on [PyPI.org](https://pypi.org) and organizer of the [London Python Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/LondonPython/). I also like to write about code, usually articles that help people get started on certain technologies or practices that I've struggled with or am passionate about. Have look at the [blog](/blog) or [Medium](https://medium.com/@yeraydiazdiaz/) if you're interested.
